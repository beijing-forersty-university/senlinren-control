## Project Intention
Make something of your own on the basis of scientific development, taking forestry applications as an example, but without prejudice to their value in other fields. Our design philosophy is to do what needs to be done, and all is replaceable, including the kernel. In Chinese, it means: 专业的事情交给专业的人来做，没有什么是不可替代的.
